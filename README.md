# Visualise

A tool designed to visualise neural networks in a simple manner.

The repository includes python notebook having the code for the neural network and a section of creating the web application, a .py file to setup the server using flask and another .py file to put a web app(running our model) on the server using streamlit. The dataset used here is the MNIST dataset.
